      content: ["I am a Software Developer from Las Vegas, Nevada. I originally majored in mechanical engineering. After getting a job under the Systems Administrator at my college, I fell in love with everything tech, specifically systems and coding. I ended up switching my major to Computer Science before the end of my first semester. My roles since then have included Systems Analyst, Accessibility Web Developer, and currently a Software Quality Assurance Intern. My strength is web development, however I am currently experimenting with App Development (React Native) and Game Development (Unity). I also have experience with C++, Java, Python, and scripting languages such as Bash.", "When I am not coding I am spending time with my family, working out, doing archery, exploring the outdoors, and trying new foods.", "My preferred weapons of choice"],
