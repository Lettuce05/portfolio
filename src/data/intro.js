// I ended up switching my major to Computer Science before the end of my first semester. My roles since then have included Systems Analyst, Accessibility Web Developer, and currently a Software Quality Assurance Intern. My strength is web development, however I am currently experimenting with App Development (React Native) and Game Development (Unity). I also have experience with C++, Java, Python, and scripting languages such as Bash.
