Welcome to my blog! This blog will be used to document my learning journey. I love to learn and experiment with different programming languages and new technologies. As I learn different things I will make blog posts summarizing what I have learned or maybe leaving useful snippets/tricks I have found while experimenting. My primary focus is web development, however I also enjoy creating projects with C#, Java, and Python. I hope that you'll join me on this journey, and hopefully learn something from/with me.
